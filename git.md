**Git and Githup**

-**Git** is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code history,

while GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool. Git is a tool a developer installs locally on their computer,

while #GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. The key difference between

Git and GitHub is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code,

while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.

One way to examine the differences between GitHub and Git is to look at their competitors. Git competes with centralized and 

distributed version control tools such as Subversion, Mercurial, ClearCase and IBM's Rational Team Concert. On the other hand,

GitHub competes with cloud-based SaaS and PaaS offerings, such as GitLab and Atlassian's Bitbucket.-
