# ** The Command Line **
The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of 
practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. 
While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on 
their desktop .

he first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory.
(You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words 
describing them.
